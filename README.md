# Random-Choice-Generator

This application allows users to enter choices into a list and a random choice will be selected. It is useful primarily in helping users make trivial decisions when they can’t decide between multiple options. With a click of a button, the app will decide for you based on the choices you give it. The application’s nature will ensure that the output is completely random.
